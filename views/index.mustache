            <p>Brand New (2016) 3 Bed Holiday Home located on 5 Star Holiday Village in Littlesea.</p>
            <p>The caravan has been designed to make good use of all space to provide ample storage and quality finish. The modern kitchen includes a fridge with freezer compartment, microwave, gas oven with hob.</p>
            <div id="anchor" class="w3-hide-small">
                <p>The master bedroom has a double bed, wardrobe storage. The lounge has feature fireplace and spacious layout to give it a true feeling of home. Just in case the weather means you retreat indoors, the full central heating and double glazing will keep you cozy in any weather while you watch the 42" HD ready TV with built in DVD player. Flooring throughout the living area is carpeted for comfort.</p>
                <p>The three bedrooms have been planned to incorporate full sized beds and ample storage space with modern lighting. One has a double bed, the other two have twin beds. A further double bed is included in the lounge where one sofa converts into a metal action spring bed.</p>
                <p>Long Weekend Friday to Monday or Midweek Monday to Friday short break bookings are an ideal opportunity to blow the cobwebs away for a few days as a relief from the pressures and stresses of working or a very nice change of environment when you are retired and have some time on your hands.</p>
                <p>Strictly NO pets and NO smoking policy.</p>
